1.	Find/research data to support and corroborate stories
2.	Find and develop narratives from these data
3.	Approach "finding" issues from both intro and intermediate tracks

###Contents
The module is divided into **Intro** and **Intermediate** levels to be applied to courses according to the appropriate experience-level of the students. 

Each level subdivides by **country** or location where the curriculum was deployed and groomed for inclusion in this repository. Many of the lessons are similar or duplicate materials, with examples that are more sensitive to the geo-particular culture and context of deployment. 

Each country designation hosts files in various formats to support the curriculum, including powerpoint presentations and pdf guides and worksheets.
